# Plot Component Demo

Here is a JUCE project that demonstrates the use of the custom plotting object I wrote called `PlotComponent`. My goal with this project was to create a poor-man's `matplotlib` in C++ that can be used in a real-time interactive context. `PlotComponent` is great for drawing filter frequency curves, FFT magnitude and phase data, and audio waveforms.
